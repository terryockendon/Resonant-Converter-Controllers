\chapter{Thesis Statement}
% Describe the problem area (why this is a problem, reason for
% investigating the problem) with some specific background (For industry
% projects it could be why this area was chosen relating to current
% situation in Industry) leading to the problem to be solved.

% The last paragraph must contain the specific aims and objectives of the
% project. Must clearly articulate the expected outcomes.
The aim of this project is to model and develop a working proof of concept inverter control system. Using a novel and relatively new control technique to reject unwanted harmonics, the approach is to use the internal model principle, and optimise state and observer gains for the resonant controller feedback. The following literature review addresses common and similar concepts associated with inverter control systems.\\
