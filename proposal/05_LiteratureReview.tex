\chapter{Literature Review}
The idea of the inverter was first published by David Prince in 1925 in an article titled ``The Inverter'' in which Prince explained how direct current (DC) is converted into single or polyphase alternating current (AC) . Commonly today, DC/AC Inverters are used to provide AC power by regulating the DC output from sources such as wind and photovoltaic (PV) energy. Over the past 20 years there has been exponential investment in renewable energy, and as such inverter technology has grown rapidly\cite{476602}.\\
Leading up to 1995, inverter technology began to change as there came a pushing demand for uninterpretable power supply (UPS) inverters that could deliver ``clean'' power. In general, inverters are relatively simple in their makeup, they take in a DC supply, pulse-width-modulate (PWM) the DC through an array of gates, and then filter the PWM signal to reconstruct a sinusoidal AC output. But, over the generations inverter models have turned to transformerless designs. These designs are increasingly used in residential, small and medium business applications due to their reduced size, increased efficiency, and reduced total harmonic distortion (THD). Inverters increasingly utilise power and control electronics technology to include additional functions like control PV sources, measurements of DC and AC parameters, monitoring and protection, and communication \cite{474857,5730644}.\\
The following literature review investigates a variety of academic sources and provides a summary of background into DC/AC Inverters with respect to the interests of the Resonant Control Converters. Sections of the review cover information relevant to filters, phase locked loop structures, state space control and state measurement, resonant controllers, and modelling and simulation.
