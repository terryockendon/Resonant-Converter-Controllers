The idea of the inverter was first published by David Prince in 1925 in an article titled ``The Inverter'' in which Prince explained how direct current (DC) is converted into single or polyphase alternating current (AC) . Today, DC/AC Inverters are used to provide AC power by regulating the DC output from sources such as wind and photovoltaic (PV) energy. Over the past 20 years there has been exponential investment in renewable energy, and as such inverter technology has grown rapidly\cite{476602}.\\
The following proposal provides background literature relevant to existing inverter topology and inverter control systems. Furthermore, the proposal outlines expected tasks, project time-line breakdown, approach methodology using existing principles, fundamental theory to the solving problem, health and safety, and quality assurance.
