\chapter{Acknowledgments}

Acknowledge your supervisor, preferably with a few short and specific
statements about his/her contribution to the content and direction of
the project.  If you collaborated with another student, acknowledge
your partner's contribution, including any parts of the thesis of
which s/he was the principal author or co-author; this information can
be duplicated in footnotes to the chapters or sections to which your
partner has contributed.  Briefly describe any assistance that you
received from technical or administrative staff.  Support of family
and friends may also be acknowledged, but avoid sentimentality---or
hide it in the dedication.
