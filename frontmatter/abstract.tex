\chapter{Abstract}

This document is a skeleton thesis for 4th-year students.  The
printable ver
show the structure of a typical thesis with some notes on the content
and purpose of each part.  The notes are meant to be informative but
not necessarily illustrative; for example, this paragraph is not
really an abstract, because it contains information not found
elsewhere in the document file
influence the form to a large
extent.  Hence this document should not be seen as an attempt to force
every thesis into the same mold.  If in doubt about the structure of
your thesis, seek advice from your supervisor.
