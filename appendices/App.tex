\appendix

% Chapters after the \appendix command are lettered, not numbered.
% Setting apart the appendices in the table of contents is awkward:

\newpage
\addcontentsline{toc}{part}{Appendices}
\mbox{}
\newpage

% The \mbox{} command between two \newpage commands gives a blank page.
% In the contents, the ``Appendices'' heading is shown as being on this
% blank page, which is the page before the first appendix.  This stops the
% first appendix from be listed ABOVE the word ``Appendices'' in the
% table of contents.

% \include appendix chapters here.
